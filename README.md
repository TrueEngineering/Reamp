# Reamp in a few words

Every ReampView (activity, fragment, whatever) has a presenter and a view state.

The presenter lives all the time across view's life cycle and dies only when the view explicitly closes (for instance, by pressing the back button).

The view state contains all the data your view needs.

Update the view state and send a notification to the view when you need to update the screen without having to pay attention to the life cycle.

Reamp will do all the remaining work: check view availability, save and restore the state if needed, and more.
